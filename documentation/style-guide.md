# Style Guide and Best Practices


> Guide on how to manage the code, documentation and solutions in these repos.
> And can be used as a basis for customer projects when no prior baseline exists

#### to do
- [ ] Turn this page into a TOC
- [ ] Have a brief 'elevator pitch' precis under each header
- [ ] Everything else in child files
- [ ] Start with the `writing style` section
	- Helps decide on how to write this guide... Very meta ;)

## Repositories
- Naming conventions
- Project structure
	- documentation
	- src
	- pipelines
	- Other files: licence, readme, .gitignore
- Branching strategies, Pull Requests, 
- Tagging, Releases
- Release notes (in `documentation` below )
- Well formed commit messages

## Code
### General


### Yaml Pipelines
- lower-case with hyphens
- yaml files always created in source, not from AzDO editor

### C#
- Reference Google or Microsoft? Or something else...
	- Don't want to list all of your own..!
	- Maybe just reference your own exceptions to the other rules?

### Typescript


## Applications
### Dynamics/PowerPlatform
- c.f the best practices document...
- Solution management
- Environment & deployment management

#### Power Portals


### Power BI


### Azure
- Component naming conventions
- ARM templates
- 

## Writing Style
### General
- I think this will be largely GDS-inspired
- Probably just largely reference other guides
- Highlight the bits you find the most important
	- What are the things that really irritate you 
- Where referenced guides disagree, highlight your decision
- Examples, etc...
- Have plenty of footnotes/references where required to save on duplicating stuff
- yaml pipelines for testing conformation to style guide 

### Solution Documentation
- XML comments
- Unit tests
- .md documentation
- Wiki
- Release notes

### Agile Artifacts
- Scrum guide reference?

#### Product Backlog
- Epics
- Features
- User Stories
- Tasks
- Bugs
- (Primarily for Azure Boards, but can include some other comments for GitHub issues)

#### Sprint artifacts
- Product goal
- Sprint goal
- Retros/Standups

### Markdown
- Has to be GitHub (and AzDO) compliant
- If there are nultiple ways of doing things in MD, pick one

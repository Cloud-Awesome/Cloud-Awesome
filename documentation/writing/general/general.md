### General
- I think this will be largely GDS-inspired
- Probably just largely reference other guides
- Highlight the bits you find the most important
	- What are the things that really irritate you 
- Where referenced guides disagree, highlight your decision
- Examples, etc...
- Have plenty of footnotes/references where required to save on duplicating stuff
- yaml pipelines for testing conformation to style guide
